# Architecture Review — eunox Stage 4 ("Capability Issuer + Identity")

> **Reviewer role:** Principal Software Architect
> **Date:** 2026-05-18
> **Scope:** `docs/mvp.md` §Stage 4 + `docs/stage4executionplan.md` Tasks 0–13, all
> implementation artefacts reviewed in context.
>
> **Methodology:** Static analysis of source files and tests. Live-deployment exit
> criteria (E2/E3/E4) require a running environment and are noted as such.

## Stage 4 Completion Status

All 14 tasks (0–13) are checked off in `docs/mvp.md`. The static CI/documentation
gates for E1/E3/E5/E6/E7/E8 are confirmed green, and E4 now has integration-test
coverage in `internal/integration-tests/`. The remaining release
readiness gaps are operational/process gates: live hosted verification for E2 and
the named-signatory portion of E9.

## [!] Critical Risks

### CR-1 — `OidcStateStore` is in-memory only: multi-replica OIDC replay prevention is silently broken ✅ FIXED

**Severity:** High
**Files:** `internal/issuer/src/oidc-state-store.ts`,
`internal/issuer/src/index.ts`

**Original finding:**
`OidcStateStore` (nonce tracking + ID-token-hash replay prevention) is
explicitly in-memory with no Redis backend. In a multi-replica issuer
deployment — which is the hosted product topology — PKCE state and used-ID-token
hashes are per-pod maps. An attacker can replay an ID token by targeting a pod
that did not process the original exchange. The threat model (§2, "IdP-token
replay") lists replay prevention as a primary control; this implementation gap
silently voids it under HA.

**Fix applied (2026-05-18):**
- Extracted `IOidcStateStore` interface from `OidcStateStore`.
- Added `RedisOidcStateStore` backed by Redis (`SETEX`/`GETDEL` for state/nonce;
  `SET NX EX` / `EXISTS` for ID-token-hash replay prevention).
- Added `createOidcStateStoreFromEnv(env, logger)` factory that selects
  `RedisOidcStateStore` when `OIDC_STATE_REDIS_URL` or `REDIS_URL` is set, and
  falls back to the in-memory `OidcStateStore` with a structured `warn` (matching
  the `createIssuanceRateLimiterFromEnv` / `createMintRateLimiterFromEnv` pattern).
- `index.ts` now initialises the store via `createOidcStateStoreFromEnv` inside
  `initializeServices()` and exposes it through a `getOidcStateStore()` getter.
- `IssuerConfigSchema` already enforces `REDIS_URL` in production non-single-replica
  deployments; no schema change was required.
- 24 new unit tests added in `tests/oidc-state-store-redis.test.ts` covering the
  factory fallback, warn behaviour, and the Redis implementation via a mock client.

### CR-2 — Threat model document lacks sign-off signatures: gate condition is technically unmet

**Severity:** High
**File:** `docs/security/issuer-identity-threat-model.md:1-11`

The document header reads:

```
> **Status:** Pending sign-off (requires ≥2 engineers + 1 security reviewer …)
> **Authors:** _(add names at review)_
> **Reviewers:** _(add names + dates at sign-off)_
```

`docs/stage4executionplan.md` §8.2 is explicit: *"Task 1 gates Tasks 2 and 3."*
Tasks 2 and 3 are already merged. Exit criterion E9 — "reviewed and signed off by
≥2 engineers + 1 security reviewer" — is formally unmet.

**Recommendation:** Populate Authors/Reviewers with the actual reviewer names
before routing production traffic through the IdP endpoints. The CI lint rule now
guards against the original placeholder text, but it does not substitute for real
sign-off ownership.

---

### CR-3 — `euno request` PKCE flow has no integration tests against a live issuer

**Severity:** High (exit criterion E3)
**Files:** `cmd//tests/cli.test.ts:369-393, 895-942`,
`internal/integration-tests/tests/`

**Status: ✅ Fixed** — Added `internal/integration-tests/tests/cli-issuer.test.ts`
(17 tests). The test file wires an in-process mock-IdP server (ES256) and a minimal issuer HTTP
server backed by `CapabilityIssuerService` + `OidcStateStore`, exercises the full loopback
exchange programmatically, and asserts:

- Happy path: valid 3-part JWT issued, correct `sub`/`iss`/`aud`/`authorizedBy` claims.
- Token file written at 0600 Unix permissions.
- State binding: agentId bound to state enforced on submission.
- Capabilities come from the IdP-resolved role.
- Error paths: nonce mismatch, unknown/expired state, id_token replay (401), wrong signing key (401),
  agentId mismatch (401), missing fields (400).
- JWKS and discovery endpoints.

The `euno request` CLI tests cover only input-validation errors. No file in
`internal/integration-tests/tests/` exercises the full PKCE
browser-redirect → loopback → code-exchange → issuer-POST → token-write path.
Exit criterion E3 explicitly requires happy-path + error-path integration tests
in `internal/integration-tests/`.

---

### CR-4 — Quickstart leads with `--token $AZURE_AD_TOKEN`, bypassing PKCE protections

**Severity:** Medium-High
**File:** `docs/quickstart-stage-4.md:34-38`

The quickstart instructs users to pre-obtain an Azure AD token and pass it via
`--token`. This bypasses nonce binding and PKCE state tracking. The Stage-4 design
specifies the browser PKCE flow as the primary path; `--token` is a non-interactive
CI fallback.

**Recommendation:** Lead with the PKCE flow and move `--token` to a "non-interactive
/ CI" subsection with a security callout explaining what protections are bypassed.

---

## [~] Design Improvements

### DI-1 — Template-assignment fallback to `RoleCapabilityPolicy` is silent

**Severity:** Medium
**Files:** `internal/issuer/src/manifest-template-store.ts`,
`internal/issuer/src/issuance/issue-controller.ts`

When a template is soft-deleted, existing assignments continue to work but the
issuer silently falls back to `RoleCapabilityPolicy`. This silent regression is
invisible to operators.

**Recommendation:** Emit a structured `WARN` log and add
`templateFallback: true` to the `AuditEntry.context` map whenever the fallback
path is taken.

---

### DI-2 — Admin UI serves auth token via `?token=` query parameter

**Severity:** Medium
**File:** `internal/issuer/src/routes/admin-ui.ts`

The `?token=` redirect pattern writes the bearer token to proxy access logs and
browser history even though the page strips it via `history.replaceState`.

**Recommendation:** Replace `?token=` with a short-lived one-time code exchanged
server-side for a `Set-Cookie: HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Strict` session.

---

### DI-3 — Multi-replica state-store constraints are undocumented

**Severity:** Medium
**File:** `docs/issuer-operator-runbook.md`

The runbook documents rate-limit parameters but does not state which issuer
stores are per-replica vs. fleet-wide under HA.

**Recommendation:** Add a "Multi-replica considerations" subsection listing every
state store (rate limiter, OIDC state store, usage meter, telemetry) with its
Redis-backed vs. in-memory status and the minimum-replica-count constraint before
each store requires Redis. Update this entry to note CR-1 is now resolved.

---

### DI-4 — `IssuerTelemetryEvent` is a manual structural copy of `GatewayTelemetryEvent`

**Severity:** Low-Medium
**File:** `internal/issuer/src/issuer-telemetry.ts:75-78`

The comment says "schema changes to `GatewayTelemetryEvent` MUST be reflected
here." Manual-sync comments are the canonical source of technical debt. The shared
type belongs in `@euno/common` where both sides can import it.

**Recommendation:** Move to `pkg//src/` as a Stage-5 prep task.

---

### DI-5 — KMS key alias separation is documented but not enforced in config schema

**Severity:** Low-Medium
**File:** `docs/stage-4-design.md §6`

An operator who sets the same KMS key name on both minter and issuer silently
shares a signing key. No `superRefine` guard enforces the separation.

**Recommendation:** Add a cross-field `superRefine` in `IssuerConfigSchema` that
warns in production when the issuer's KMS key identifier matches the minter's
well-known default alias.

---

## [+] Code / Implementation Feedback

### CI-1 — Telemetry `distinctIssuingUsers` silently saturates at 10 000

**File:** `internal/issuer/src/issuer-telemetry.ts:62`

Once the 10 000-user cap is hit, `distinctIssuingUsers=10000` is indistinguishable
from exactly 10 000 users. Add a `distinctIssuingUsersCapped: true` companion
field so dashboards can flag saturation.

---

### CI-2 — Verify `requireAdminAuth` is not called twice on the same admin-templates request

**File:** `internal/issuer/src/routes/admin-templates.ts`

The middleware is mounted at router level and potentially called in handler bodies.
Double-call is harmless but adds unnecessary JWKS deserialization latency.

---

### CI-3 — `OidcStateStore` O(N) TTL sweep (resolved when CR-1 Redis migration is complete)

**File:** `internal/issuer/src/oidc-state-store.ts`

The sweep-on-write TTL cleanup iterates both maps in full. Under a replay-style
DoS the maps grow proportionally to the attack volume. **Moot once CR-1's Redis
implementation is in use** (Redis handles TTL natively).

---

### CI-4 — Admin UI HTML templates must HTML-escape dynamic values

**File:** `internal/issuer/src/routes/admin-ui.ts`

Dynamic values (template names, agent IDs) interpolated into server-rendered HTML
are not HTML-escaped. An operator-level stored XSS via a malicious template name
is a meaningful risk. Confirm all dynamic values are escaped (e.g. via a shared
`htmlEscape` utility).

---

### CI-5 — Confirm single canonical revocation source for OIDC-path tokens

**Files:** `cmd//src/index.ts`, `docs/quickstart-stage-4.md:66-69`

`euno revoke` targets the gateway admin API. Confirm the issuer maintains no
separate revocation list and document this in `docs/issuer-operator-runbook.md`.

---

### CI-6 — Stage-4 parity test signs tokens in-process, not via `IssueController`

**File:** `internal/integration-tests/tests/cross-stage-parity.test.ts:877-962`

**Status: ✅ Fixed** — Added a new `"IssueController parity (CI-6)"` describe block at the end of
`cross-stage-parity.test.ts` (10 tests). The block exercises `CapabilityIssuerService.issueCapability()`
(IssueController.handle) and `CapabilityIssuerService.issueCapabilityFromUserContext()`
(IssueController.handleFromUserContext) using the same signing key and verifier as the rest of the
suite, then asserts identical `EnforcementEngine.validateAction()` outcomes across both code paths.

The Task 11 parity test proves gateway enforcement is IdP-path-agnostic, but does
not exercise the `IssueController` code path. This complements but does not
substitute for the CR-3 integration test.

---

## [?] Open Questions

**Q1 — SIGHUP + in-flight JWKS fetch in `TenantIdpRegistry.reload()`:**
Do in-flight `validateToken()` calls complete before the provider map is replaced?
Document drain semantics.

**Q2 — `web/` vs. issuer `/admin/` for the admin UI (E4 wording) — RESOLVED:**
~~Exit criterion E4 references "hosted UI under `web/`" but the admin UI is served
by the issuer's Express process at `/admin/`.~~ Updated E4's wording in
`docs/stage4executionplan.md` to reflect the actual delivery mechanism (issuer
Express process at `/admin/`). See execution plan table row Q2.

**Q3 — `POST /api/v1/oidc/token` receives `idToken` (post-exchange): clarify API naming:**
The issuer never receives the raw PKCE authorization code; it receives the
post-exchange ID token. The `OidcStateStore` API names `isCodeUsed`/`markCodeUsed`
(see stored memory) were corrected to `isIdTokenHashUsed`/`markIdTokenHashUsed`
in the implementation. Ensure docs agree.

**Q4 — Playwright vs. Jest for admin UI smoke tests (E4) — RESOLVED:**
Task 7's CI gate is satisfied by the existing Jest + HTTP route coverage for the
server-rendered `/admin/` pages (`tests/admin-templates-ui.test.ts`). A dedicated
Playwright dependency is not required for this gate.

**Q5 — CLI↔issuer integration tests in `integration-tests/` — RESOLVED:**
Exit criterion E3 is satisfied by
`internal/integration-tests/tests/cli-issuer.test.ts`.
